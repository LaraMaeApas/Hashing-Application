# Hashing-Application 

# Introduction:

The Phone Book Application is a simple Java console program that uses a hash table (HashMap) to manage contact information. It allows users to add, retrieve, delete,
and display contacts efficiently. Hash tables enable fast data storage and retrieval, making them ideal for such tasks.

# Features:

•	Add a contact (name and phone number).
•	Retrieve a contact by name.
•	Delete a contact by name.
•	Display all stored contacts.

# Why this application was created

This application was created as part of a laboratory activity to deepen understanding of hashing and hash table data structures.
The project demonstrates the practical use of these concepts in solving real-world problems, such as managing data efficiently.

# How it contributes

For Learning: Enhances understanding of hashing and data structures.
Practical Use: Provides a simple, efficient contact management tool.
Foundation: Serves as a starting point for more advanced applications.
